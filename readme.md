Section 1: Features
Title: Personalized cirriculum and education plan. Just for you.

We're QuazziWeb. We help ease the learning process for busy individuals who wish to take the self-teaching route into web development. You're still teaching yourself. But with us, you're not alone!

100% Free
Self-teaching is all about the taking the inexpensive route. Let's keep it that way. We just want to see you level up!

Curated & Tailored for you
The QuazziWeb team works with you to create an education plan that fits your schedule and needs. Learn what you want to learn. Work on what you want to work on.

1-on-1 mentorship
Have a single point of contact, QuazziWeb's Daniel, to provide unlimited support and keep you accountable with weekly 1-on-1 meetings. Available anytime you need a question, he's just a text message away.

Online & Self-Paced
We get it. Life's busy. With a QuazziWeb cirriculum, you can study on your own pace from anywhere with internet access. You don't have to be in Arizona over at Daniel's house to learn some code, do you?

Title: Our customers can't live without us

Omnifood is just awesome! I just launched a startup which leaves me with no time for cooking, so Omnifood is a life-saver. Now that I got used to it, I couldn't live without my daily meals!
(Michelle C)

Inexpensive, healthy and great-tasting meals, delivered right to my home. We have lots of food delivery here in Lisbon, but no one comes even close to Omifood. Me and my family are so in love!
(David Vuong)

I was looking for a quick and easy food delivery service in San Franciso. I tried a lot of them and ended up with Omnifood. Best food delivery service in the Bay Area. Keep up the great work!
